# Overview

Learning object oriented and test driven development principles in Python.

Hedgehog Garden is a console based game where you collect and take care of hedgehogs.
You can wash, feed, and exercise them. Each hedgehog has stats that you want to max out.
When a hedgehog's stats are maxed out, you get a new hedgehog. The goal of the game is to
collect the last "special" hedgehog and max out their stats.

By writing this software, I hope to provide a fun and relaxing game for people to enjoy.
I also hope to better understand programming concepts in Python.
